Classical Protein Electric Field Topology (https://github.com/matthew-hennefarth/CPET) but in python, and built for high-throughput accelerated calculations 

Original code in C++ is by Matthew Hennerfarth

To do items:

- Finish field calculation
- Improve options parsing
- Accelerate topology calcs
- Try gridding topology calcs
- Add cylinder and sphere region options
- Test invariances
